Research Assignment #1: Memos
1. Vulnerability of Renters and Low-Income Households to Storm Damage: 
Evidence From Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico 

Memo: 
Empirical research that describes the patterns of the distribution of 
housing assistance using FEMA relief funds. "OpenFEMA Individual 
Assistance Dataset" 
This dataset could be used to understand economic patterns post-disaster 
based on socio-factors like home ownership status, which relates to health 
outcomes.
Using housing data could be useful if I’m looking into displacement after 
climate disasters; who gets to stay and who has to leave.

2. As Disaster Costs Rise, So Does Inequality

This article merges county-level data of property damages with household 
longitudinal survey data of income dynamics to examine long-term social 
inequalities related to climate hazards. 
The data is accessible through SHELDUS but was not available to access 
without payment, therefore, I did not need to email to obtain (codebook 
was found in their README, which I downloaded in code subfolder)

 This data provides a way to assess environmental ‘hazard’ and ‘peril’ 
serverity per county, which could be used with corresponding county-level 
health data to assess pre and post disaster health outcomes.
Costs money to retrieve raw data.

3.  The Gendered Nature of Natural Disasters: The Impact of Catastrophic Events on the Gender Gap in Life Expectancy, 1981–2002 

This article analyzes the strength of disasters by looking at its 
mortality rates and its interaction with the ses of women and their life 
expectancy, obtained via EM-DAT database.
Using this database I could compare transnational health outcome datasets
related to natural or technological disasters.
